# Flatiron Data Science School Projects
I was accepted at Flatiron School with a Start date of November 9, 2020.  Prior to school start, I began my prep work by doing the following:
* Forking this curriculum repository to my working repositor
* Installing Anaconda, PyCharm, and R
* Configuring my local environment with the required packages
* Syncing Github to PyCharm

## Configuring Anaconda to Work with PyCharm On Mac OSX
This was not an easy task as a newbie.  However, I by creating my own environments (env), then figuring out where they are located on the Mac OSX, I was able to have a bit more control. My Path on Anaconda is:

PATH: /Users/mj163/opt/anaconda3/envs/"Environment Name"

This absolutely maps to the Anaconda Console

## Porting In The Packages
After syncing up the directories with Anaconda and PyCharm,  PyCharm evaluates the code and attempts to determine the packages you need.

**NOTE: You May Have to Manually Install the R and Jupyter Packages **

##Why PyCharm and Anaconda

Well, I use Anaconda to manage my environments (env).  I use PyCharm to test the code. I want to point out this may not work for everyone.

This is what my Jupyter Notebook Intro looks like in PyCharm:
